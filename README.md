# meJep
Jeopardy-like Gameshow adapted to a fantasy world. meJep is the abbreviation for Middle-earth Jeopardy.
## History
Years ago I wrote a web-based Jeopardy-like game for the annual meeting of the German Tolkien Society which was based on the Smarty Template engine and a custom MySQL database to catagorise and store the answers (and questions).
After the initial version and some years of bugfixing I stopped any further development which ran into the issue of outdated dependencies.
So I switched over to another Jeopardy-like game system now based on JavaScript with the data taken from the original database.
